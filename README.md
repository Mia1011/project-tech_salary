# Data Analysis of Tech Salary with R
This project aims to explore the reasons influencing salaries within the tech industry. By analyzing a dataset from an anonymous tech company, we delve into the correlations and patterns between salary levels and various factors.  

## Background
During my exchange program in Germany, I acquired proficiency in the R programming language through Biostatistics course. Inspired by a podcast's discussion on gender-salary dynamics and driven by my aspiration to work in the tech industry, I embarked on this project.  

## Files
- Dataset (.csv): This file contains 6,704 records of employees from a tech company. It includes six columns — Age, Gender, Education Level, Job Title, Years of Experience, and Salary.
- Analysis Script (.rmd): The R Markdown file comprises original code chunks and explanatory text.
- Project Report (.pdf): The PDF document discribes the project's findings, presenting visualizations, analyses, and interpretations.

## Results
When it comes to the gender factor, men earn $13.500 more than women annually. Also, men have a higher payment peak at $250.000, while women can only earn up to $220.000 per year.

As for the education factor, we can tell from the means that the average salary will increase with education level.

Last but not least, the plot for both work experience and education factor is quite interesting. In general, people with higher degrees have higher salaries “on average”. However, there are some interactions between Bachelor's and Master's Degree, which worth a further discussion.
