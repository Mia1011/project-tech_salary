# Tech Salary Analysis Across Gender, Education, and Experience

## Introduction
This project examines the key factors influencing salary levels within the tech industry. By analyzing a dataset from an anonymous tech company, we aim to uncover the correlations and patterns between salary and various contributing factors such as gender, education level, and work experience. We provide visualization and statistical analysis to better interpret these relationships and draw meaningful conclusions about tech salary distribution. 

## Files Overview
- `SalaryData.csv` is the dataset originally downloaded from Kaggle (now unavailable). It contains 6,704 records of tech employees, with six columns: *Age*, *Gender*, *Education Level*, *Job Title*, *Years of Experience*, and *Salary*.
- `Code.Rmd` is the R Markdown file containing both R code chunks and explanatory text.
- `Report.pdf` is the compiled report generated by knitting the R Markdown file. It presents visualizations, statistical analyses, and key interpretations.

## How to run
- Install R and RStudio by following [this guide](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html). 
- Clone and download this repository to your local machine.
- Open the file `Code.Rmd` in RStudio.
- Install required packages by running: 
  ```{R}
  install.packages(c("effectsize", "tidyverse", "apa", "pwr"))
  ```
- Make sure `SalaryData.csv` is in the same directory as the Rmd file.
- Run the R scripts chunk by chunk. 

## Libraries & Techniques
This project was completed using R, with the following key packages and techniques:
- tidyverse: For data wrangling and visualization (`dplyr`, `ggplot`)
  - `dplyr` is for transforming and cleaning data
  - `ggplot2` is to create violin plots, boxplots, and smoothed trend lines (`geom_smooth`)
- stats (base R): For hypothesis testing including **t-tests**, **F-tests**, **Post-Hoc Test**, and **ANOVA**
- APA-style reporting: Applied concepts of effect size (e.g., Cohen’s d, η²) and confidence intervals in interpretation

## Key Results
When it comes to the gender factor, men earn $13.500 more than women annually. Also, men have a higher payment peak at $250.000, while women can only earn up to $220.000 per year.

As for the education factor, we can tell from the means that the average salary will increase with education level.

Last but not least, the plot for both work experience and education factor is quite interesting. In general, people with higher degrees have higher salaries “on average”. However, there are some interactions between Bachelor's and Master's Degree, which worth a further discussion.
